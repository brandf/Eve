# Eve

> Eve is to inference what Adam is to training.

**Eve** is an LLM architectural concept that reimagines transformer layer updates as an **adaptive, momentum-driven integration process**—analogous to the Adam optimizer, but applied to **hidden-state evolution through depth** rather than to weight updates through time.
